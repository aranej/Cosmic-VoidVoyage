# Project Brief: Cosmic-VoidVoyage

**Vision:** To create an immersive, meditative, and visually stunning web experience that takes the user on a first-person journey through deep space to one of several beautifully rendered nebulae, perfectly synchronized with an atmospheric musical score. The primary goal is to evoke a sense of wonder, relaxation, and awe, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser while remaining highly performant.

## 1. Core Concept & Vision

Inspired by the dynamic 3D scenes of artists like `@techartist_`, this project is not a static visualization but a curated **journey**. The user selects a destination (a nebula) and a soundtrack (from Suno AI), and the experience unfolds as an automated, seamless flight. The synchronization between the flight's duration and the music's length is the central pillar of the experience, ensuring deep immersion without interruption.

The emotional target is a tranquil, almost existential experience—a digital escape that feels vast, beautiful, and calming.

## 2. Key Features

-   **Nebula Selection:** The user can choose from **5 distinct, visually unique nebulae** to be their flight destination.
-   **Music Selection:** A library of **10 unique musical tracks** (generated by Suno AI) will be available.
    -   Users can manually select a track for their journey.
    -   An "auto-assign" feature will also be available to pair a random track with the selected nebula.
-   **Dynamic Synchronization:** The core technical feature. The flight duration **MUST** dynamically and precisely match the selected audio track's duration. The journey ends exactly when the music concludes.
-   **Automated Camera Flight:** The experience is a non-interactive flight. The camera will move along a smooth, predefined spline path from a starting point in deep space to the heart of the selected nebula.
-   **Minimalist UI:** The user interface for selection will be non-intrusive, appearing on user interaction and fading out completely once the journey begins, allowing for a full-screen, uninterrupted visual experience.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Flow

1.  **Initial Load:** A minimal loading screen is displayed while essential assets are loaded. A single, clear call-to-action (e.g., "Begin Journey") is presented to the user. This initial interaction is required to comply with browser audio autoplay policies.
2.  **Selection Phase:** Upon clicking the initial button, the minimalist selection UI fades in. The user selects a nebula and a music track.
3.  **The Journey:** Once the selection is confirmed, the UI fades out. The chosen music begins to play, and the camera starts its flight through space.
4.  **End State:** As the music fades out at its conclusion, the flight smoothly decelerates and the scene fades to black. A simple UI then appears with options like "Fly Again" or "Choose a New Destination".

## 4. Technical Stack & Architecture

This stack is definitive based on prior research.

-   **Core Library:** **Three.js** (latest stable version).
    -   **CRITICAL:** This project will target the **WebGL Renderer ONLY**. The `WebGPURenderer` is explicitly **out of scope** due to current performance and stability issues.
-   **Build Tool:** **Vite**.
-   **Language:** **TypeScript**.
-   **Styling:** **Plain CSS**. No CSS frameworks are to be used to keep the project lightweight.
-   **Deployment:** **Vercel (Free Tier)**.

## 5. Critical Constraints & Requirements

All implementation must adhere to the following constraints:

-   **Vercel Free Tier:** All development must be mindful of the limitations of Vercel's free plan.
    -   **Bandwidth:** Asset sizes (textures, audio) must be aggressively optimized.
    -   **Bundle Size:** The final JavaScript bundle must be as small as possible.
    -   **Build Times:** The build process must be efficient.
-   **Performance Budget:**
    -   **Target FPS:** 60 FPS.
    -   **Minimum Acceptable FPS:** 30 FPS.
    -   **Target Hardware:** A mid-range desktop GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1060 or equivalent). Performance on lower-end hardware should degrade gracefully.
-   **Visual Style:** The goal is **Stylized Realism**, not photorealism. The experience should look beautiful and artistic, inspired by Hubble imagery, but must be optimized for real-time web performance. High-polygon models and computationally expensive volumetric raymarching should be avoided in favor of clever shader work, particle systems, and post-processing.
-   **Browser Compatibility:** The primary targets are the latest versions of modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Mobile support is a secondary goal ("nice-to-have") and should not compromise the performance or quality of the primary desktop experience.

## 6. Asset Pipeline

-   **Audio:**
    -   Source: Suno AI.
    -   Format: A web-optimized format like **MP3 (192kbps)** or **OGG** should be used.
    -   Loading Strategy: **Lazy-loading on demand** is mandatory. Only the selected audio track should be downloaded by the user, not the entire library at once.
-   **Visuals (Nebulae):**
    -   A performance-first approach is required. The primary options to be investigated are:
        1.  **Procedural Generation:** Using GLSL shaders and noise functions to create nebulae at runtime. (Preferred for small file size).
        2.  **Optimized Textures:** Using 2D texture layers combined with particle effects. Textures must be compressed using a modern format like **KTX2 / Basis Universal** to minimize VRAM and file size.
    -   High-resolution (4K+) textures are out of scope. 1K or 2K is the maximum.

## 7. Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

The project is considered successful when:
-   It is successfully deployed and running on a Vercel free tier account.
-   The initial load time on a standard broadband connection is under 5 seconds.
-   The experience maintains a stable 30-60 FPS on the target hardware.
-   All key features (5 nebulae, 10 tracks, sync, UI) are functional.
-   The audio and visual experience is smooth, free of glitches, and works correctly in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on desktop.

## 8. Out of Scope for Initial Version

The following features are not to be included in the initial release but may be considered for future iterations:
-   VR/WebXR support.
-   Interactive camera controls during the flight.
-   Mobile-specific optimizations and touch controls.
-   Physics-based particle simulations.
-   Procedural generation of the flight path.
